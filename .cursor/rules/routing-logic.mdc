# Routing & Module Standards

- **Routing Hierarchy**:
  - Define routes in `src/routes/index.tsx`.
- **Menu Sync**:
  - Ensure side menu configuration in `src/routes/menuConfig.tsx` stays in sync with actual routing.
- **Page Layout**:
  - New pages should be created in `src/pages/` and wrapped within appropriate layout components.
- **References**:
  - Refer to [ROUTING_STANDARDS.md](file:///Users/njwander/code/boss/demo/jiaofu-demo/guidelines/ROUTING_STANDARDS.md) for more details.
