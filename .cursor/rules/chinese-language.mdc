# Chinese Language Preference

- Always use **Chinese** (中文) for all communications, documentation, and logic explanations.
- The following documents MUST be written in Chinese:
  - `implementation_plan.md`
  - `task.md`
  - `walkthrough.md`
- When the user asks technical questions or requests code changes, provide clear and concise explanations in Chinese.
